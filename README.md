# üé¨ fabrika-overlays-releases-draft

This is a derivative of a tool I designed and developed entirely on my own a couple of years ago. I initially built it to solve my own workflow challenges, and later shared it with colleagues. It was a personal initiative that proved useful in that work context. This tool addresses a very specific need, but for those who do face this challenge, it can be a real time-saver.

This app allows you to combine videos, variable information for each video, and artwork, then output either a video editing project (Final Cut XML Exchange format, which can be imported into most modern editing tools) or image overlays (PNGs) for each video.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Philosophy Behind the Tool

Instead of manually editing each video, you define a single visual layout and feed it with a spreadsheet of data. The tool takes care of the rest: generating ready-to-use overlays that match your data and media.
It‚Äôs interoperable with existing editing workflows, thanks to outputs like PNGs and Final Cut XML (importable into most modern editing software).

# üöÄ Going Forward

There are several opportunities to improve this tool. I‚Äôd like to continue developing it, but future work depends on reaching a sufficiently large audience. Consider this section a declaration of intent: if the tool gains adoption, I‚Äôll keep updating and expanding it.

Planned improvements include:

* In-place creation/editing of datasets

* A more responsive video preview player

* Export of encoded videos (currently exports editing projects in Final Cut XML format)

* In/out layer group animations

* Interactive timeline

* Cross-platform support (Windows/Linux/Mac)
